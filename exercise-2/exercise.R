## exercise 2 -- if/else statement
## now you know how to do the basic syntax in R, let's play with if/else statements
## the game is called 'is it going to rain in Seattle?'

## make a variable called 'chance_of_rain' and assign it to be 0

## assign 'true' or 'false' to a variable named 'I_saw_raindrops'

## assign 'true' or 'false' to a variable named 'my_shoes_are_wet'

## assign 'true' or 'false' to a variable named 'my_ta_is_soaked'

## assign 'true' or 'false' to a variable named 'I_love_cookies'

## ok, now you have your variables ready to go.

## make an if statement that checks whether you saw raindrops
## if you did, set chance_of_rain to 100

## else make an if statement that checks whether your shoes are wet
## if they are, chance of rain goes up by 40 percent

## else make an if statement that checks whether your TA is soaked
## if you did, chance of rain goes up by 50 percent

## make an if statement that checks whether you love cookies
## if you don't, give a reason why not

## Finally print out a sentence that says 'The chance of rain in Seattle is (the number stored in chance_of_rain variable) percent'

## bonus:
## how to make write this exercise in a function??
